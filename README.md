# agents.txt
An emerging standard for managing AI agent access to websites, providing authenticated, optimised, and monetisable access for AI agents while protecting web infrastructure.

# Status: Request for Comments
This repository contains the draft specification for agents.txt, a proposed standard for AI agent authentication and access control. We're currently gathering feedback from AI companies and website operators.

# The Problem

## For Websites 🌐 
As AI agents become more prevalent on the web, websites need better ways to:
- Authenticate legitimate AI agents
- Expose AI-optimised interfaces
- Control and monetise AI agent's access to their data
- Protect their infrastructure
- Maintain quality of service for human users

## For AI Agent Operators 🤖
- No standard way to discover automated interaction points or prove legitimate status
- Risk of breaking when websites change their UI
- High computation costs from processing human-focused interfaces
- Increasing website blocks threatening business viability
- Rising infrastructure costs from anti-bot measures

## The Solution 🧠
agents.txt aims to establish a standard for:

1. Authentication & Access Control
- Cryptographic authentication of legitimate AI agents
- Tiered access management
- Usage-based monetization

2. AI Interaction Protocols
- Declare AI-optimized endpoints
- Define structured interaction paths
- Specify available automated actions
- Document data schemas
